Firstly you need to create a folder named "faces dataset"
Secondly you should run the dataset_maker.py It would automatically add references of your face in the folder we created on previous step
You can make it as many times as you want
Finally you can run the "detect_face_video.py" which would show the most likely name of person if it already in database and if he is not, it would show "unknown"
